    "My name is Natalie Lopez and I am beginning the Data Analytics Pathway with a strong interest in research that creates measurable impact. My interest in cryptography has shaped how I approach complexity and recognize structure and meaning within data. I am drawn to data analytics because it offers a disciplined way to transform information into practical insight. One of my goals is to develop an artificial intelligence agent that supports my sister, who works for a non-profit organization that helps women and children. I want to create tools that streamline her work and enhance her ability to expand the organizationâ€™s reach and effectiveness. Through this program I aim to strengthen my technical skills, broaden my analytical perspective, and apply data-driven methods to meaningful, real-world challenges."
